# Playlist Scraper

Small Python Tool, to webscrape webradio playlists.

Idea:
There are plenty of good webradio stations. But I want their songs in a spotify, deezer, etc. playlist. But unfortunately the playlist of the most stations is resettet every couple of hours.
The Python tool scrapes the songs, makes a proper data formatting, removes double values and saves an unique playlist per station.

## To-Do
- Python webdata scraping
- data formatting
- sort & double value removal
- import/ update the songs to a spotify playlist
